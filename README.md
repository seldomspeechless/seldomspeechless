Backstory
Like most biographical stories, mine began with a lot of gaming. First few games that I came across that are worth mentioning were Scarab of Ra(Macintosh, 1988), Dune II(PC, 1992) and Master of Orion(PC, 1993). Later Starcraft(PC, 1998) and Counter-Strike(PC, 1999) came into my life. Owned a total of zero consoles in my lifetime which is something of a bother. But what can you do? At that age you totally rely on gear provided by your parents. I've not included hand-held ones like Game & Watch. Plenty of them.
Been programming since I knew what it was. Solving problems with code quickly became a drug.
Today I am happily married with two cats. (I am aware of how wrong that sounds and that always makes me giggle. Love using languages the wrong way.) No kids or cars.
